# Public iPerf3 servers in Russia

List of public iPerf3 servers in Russia, checked daily for availability.

## How it works
- The server list is stored in YAML format in `list.yml`.
- The script automatically tests each iPerf3 server and records the results in the table below.

## Suggest more servers
We need more servers! Please create an issue or PR if you know of others.

## Test script
```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itdoginfo/russian-iperf3-servers/refs/heads/main/speedtest.sh)
```

Fast Mode
```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itdoginfo/russian-iperf3-servers/refs/heads/main/speedtest.sh) -f
```

### Dependencies
- iperf3
- jq
- ping
- awk

### Fallback
For each city, there is a primary and a fallback server. The test first checks the primary server across the port range 5201â€“5209, only if all ports fail does it fall back to the secondary server. In the results table, this is marked as "City (F)".
